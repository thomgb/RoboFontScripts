# Compare

A RoboFont Script that compares open and checked fonts.

It writes the fonts family name and style name, number of contours of the current glyph, and number of points in each contours next to the glyph. Above that it writes the same information of the same glyph in the other fonts. 
Easy to see if contour orders are misaligned or a contours has a point too many.

A little window shows the open fonts. Tick the box to let the font participate.
Double-click the font to make that font the current font. Easy!
