# Cross Overlap
A RoboFont extension for easily adding an overlap.
#### Currently it only works with straight lines.

### Working
- Select two points where the overlap is required
- Click the CrossOverlap-button

note: 
- Currently it only works well with straight lines.
- Currently it only works if the two selected points are in the same contour.

TODO:
- Multiple contours.
- Better dealing with curves.
- Check straight lines only in the overlap part of the glyph.
