# Cross Overlap
A RoboFont extension for easily adding an overlap.

### Working
- Select two points where the overlap is required
- Click the CrossOverlap-button

![Preview](https://github.com/thomgb/RoboFontScripts/blob/master/extentions_dev/AddCrossOverlap/addCrossOverlap.gif)

note: 
- Currently it only works well with straight lines.
- Currently it only works if the two selected points are in the same contour.

TODO:
- [ ] Multiple contours.
- [ ] Better dealing with curves.
- [x] Check straight lines only in the overlap part of the glyph. [v0.3]
